# OctAIvius - AI Chatbot Electron Desktop Application

Note: Desktop-first. The only supported renderer entry is the React app built via Vite at `src/renderer/react/index.html` (output to `dist/renderer`). Legacy pre-React HTML files are deprecated and removed from active use.

## Overview

This project implements a comprehensive AI chatbot desktop application with voice dictation capabilities, function calling, and Model Context Protocol (MCP) server integration. The application is built using Electron with TypeScript and provides secure IPC communication between main and renderer processes.

## Architecture

The application follows an Electron desktop architecture with the following key components:

### Core Components

- **Electron Main Process**: Window management, IPC handlers, and system integration
- **Electron Renderer Process**: Frontend interface with secure communication bridge
- **IPC Communication**: Secure inter-process communication for chat and services
- **Voice Processing**: Client-side Web Speech API + planned server-side STT
- **Function Calling**: Secure execution of system functions via IPC
- **MCP Integration**: Communication with Model Context Protocol servers
- **AI Integration**: Claude/OpenAI integration for conversational AI

```

Legacy Express server code, static `public/` assets, and vanilla renderer HTML/JS files were removed to simplify the codebase for an Electron + React only architecture.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn
- Audio input device (for voice features)

### Installation

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd GVAIBot

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration

# Build the application
npm run build

# Start the Electron application
npm start
```

### Development

```bash
# Build and start the Electron app
npm start

# Build only (compile TypeScript)
npm run build

# Package for current platform
npm run pack

# Create distributable packages
npm run dist

# Clean build directory
npm run clean
```

## Configuration

The application uses environment variables for configuration. See the included `.env` file for current settings. The app supports:

- **AI Providers**: Anthropic Claude, OpenAI GPT (with API keys)
- **Environment Modes**: Development, production
- **Logging Levels**: Error, warn, info, debug
- **Theme Support**: Dark/light mode with persistence

## Current Status

### âœ… Working Features

- Electron application launches with React UI
- Chat interface using IPC backed AI service (mock/real provider integration)
- Theme support (dark/light)
- Voice recording hooks prepared (IPC wiring ready)
- Configuration retrieval via preload bridge
- Secure IPC + context isolation
- Structured logging (Winston)

### ðŸš§ In Development

- Full AI provider streaming responses
- Transcription pipeline integration with voice service

## Architecture Notes

Originally an Express + static HTML prototype, the project has been refactored into a focused Electron + React application. All HTTP server and legacy static asset layers were removed, reducing maintenance surface and eliminating duplicate UI paths.
